# EC 441 – Intro to Computer Networking (Spring 2026)

## Repository Overview

This repository contains my weekly assignments and final project for EC 441. Each submission is an artifact demonstrating engagement with networking concepts, covering topics across all five layers of the network stack.

## Generative AI Usage

I plan to use **Claude (Anthropic)** as my primary generative AI tool for brainstorming and tailoring my reports. I will update this section as the semester progresses with details on how these tools were actually used.

## Repository Structure

Submissions are organized by week and topic:

```
